# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a diverse collection of projects covering various subjects within the field of data science. From data analysis to machine learning, each project offers insights into different aspects of working with data. Below is a brief overview of some projects included in this repository:

## Project 1: IMDb Movies Management System

**Description:** This project focuses on data collection, manipulation, and basic analysis using movie data from IMDb. It includes functionalities for scraping movie information, storing it in a SQLite database, listing movies based on different criteria (e.g., all movies, seen movies, unseen movies), updating the "seen" status of movies, and randomly selecting a movie to watch based on genre preference.

**Technologies Used:** Python, BeautifulSoup, SQLite, pandas, numpy

## Project 2: Digit Recognition with Real-time Classification

**Description:** This project implements a digit recognition system using machine learning in Python and a user interface in JavaScript. The machine learning model is trained to recognize handwritten digits using a dataset like MNIST. The user can draw a digit on the interface, and the system will perform real-time classification to identify the drawn digit.

**Technologies Used:** Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras), JavaScript
